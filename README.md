## Hello üëã 

I'm Ogechukwu S. Okeke, an aspiring data analyst with experience in sales, finance, tourism and logisticsüí∞.

Fascinated by the impact of data on business operations, I'm retraining as a data analyst. And am enjoying every second of the path I chose. I hope to blend my newfound data analysis skills with existing business knowledge to bring unique insights into any future role I find myself in.

I currently work on my Data Visualization skills and have so much fun doing it ‚ù§. Please follow me on Tableau Public via @sylvia54 to see my projects.

I love learning new things, and I'm a very curious person; INTJ-T personality.

Outside of work, I love travelling to new places and meeting people! Also, I love to play basketball.

I enjoy connecting with new people; give me a shout at üìß sylviaokeke54@gmail.com, on Twitter (@ogesylvi), Instagram, or on LinkedIn!
